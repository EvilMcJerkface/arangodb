# Deployment

Foxx services can be deployed in multiple ways to a single server instance
or all the coordinators of a cluster:

- [Foxx CLI](../../Programs/FoxxCLI/README.md), a command line tool which
  requires Node.js

- [HTTP API](../../../HTTP/Foxx/index.html) using HTTP requests,
  e.g. with curl

- [Web UI](../../Programs/WebInterface/README.md) under *SERVICES*
